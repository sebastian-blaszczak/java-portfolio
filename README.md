# 1. Anagram algorithm
According to Wikipedia:
>An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

So I created an anagram solver that:
* Inputs of solver are two equal sized arrays of string,
* Output is a List of Boolean, if two words are anagrams then it will show true if not it will show false.

Solver was tested by set of cases:

'''markdown
String[] words1 = new String[]{"more", "snail", "atom"};
String[] words2 = new String[]{"rome", "nails", "bomb"};
'''

Sorce code and tests are in [anagram-algorithm](https://github.com/sebastian-blaszczak/java-portfolio/tree/master/anagram-algorithm).
